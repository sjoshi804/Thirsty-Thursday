# Design Choices

## Removing relational fields (manyToMany, ForeignKey) etc. and replacing with ArrayField(char ...)
While it may be more logically appropriate to use relational fields, to capture information
when it comes to such relations, this increases the overhead of every API call as it is more complex
and carries more data than necessary. Hence, the decision was made to sacrifice some extent of ease
of usage to minimize how expensive every API call will be.
